# wpScanner
A very basic WordPress files and directories scanner.

I've just started learning python and decided to make it.

Usage:
1. Clone this repo. <code>git clone https://github.com/nb1b3k/wpScanner.git</code>
2. Install the requirements. <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>
3. Run the .py file <code>python wpScanner.py</code>
